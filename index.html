    <h1>Task: JavaScript classes and inheritance</h1>
    <p>Create a base class that will contain common methods. Then create 2 child classes (inherit from base): IntBuilder
        in ES6 style and StringBuilder in ES5 style. Almost all methods should be chainable for handy usage. You can add
        any own methods and properties to the classes BUT! methods described bellow must be in your solution</p>
